## Customization

Machine-specific configs are kept in `~/.config/hypr/local/` and are not tracked by git. The install script generates these from templates in `.data/hyprland/templates/` on first run:

- `monitors.conf` - Monitor layout
- `workspaces.conf` - Workspace mapping
- `extra_environment.conf` - Local environment variables
- `autostart.conf` - Local autostart programs
- `extra_keybinds.conf` - Local keybinds

### Wallpapers

Wallpapers live in `~/.local/wallpapers/` (git-ignored, defaults copied on install) and are managed through the QuickShell wallpaper picker (`Super + B`). Features include:

- **Search** by filename
- **Favorites** with persistent state
- **Theme wallpapers** organized in `~/.local/wallpapers/themes/{theme-name}/`
- Each theme can have multiple wallpapers; the active one is set from the picker and applied automatically on theme switch

### Adding Themes

Themes are JSON files in `~/.local/themes/` (git-ignored, defaults copied from `.data/themes/` on install). Each theme defines colors for the palette, terminal, Hyprland, Neovim, and an optional wallpaper path. To create a new theme, copy an existing one and modify the values.
